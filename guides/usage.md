# Usage

Mochi has a CLI, albeit, it's not tested much. Use at your own risk.
> **Note:** I use it. Most commands just add a controller and/or a migration with `auth` being the heaviest. Nothing crazy. The cli outputs all files that were created/modified so it's pretty easy to check as well.

The cli follows `mochi g template class_name orm` so `mochi g auth user granite` generates the auth template with `User` as the class name and granite is the orm you are using.
